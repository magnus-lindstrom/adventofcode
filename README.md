# Fetching data from website

You need to store your session cookie from the aoc website in a `.session_cookie` file at the repo
root. In Chrome (or Brave), find it under "Inspect (F12) > Application > Storage > Cookies >
session".

When you have saved your session cookie, simply run the script `get_daily_inputs.sh` from one of the
folders representing a year. The input files will be stored under `inputs/X` files.
